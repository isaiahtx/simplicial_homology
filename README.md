# simplicial_homology
Calculates simplicial homology of abstract simplicial complexes. Currently uses this [smithnormalform](https://pypi.org/project/smithnormalform/) library, which has issues with large matrices. I plan on implementing the algorithm myself at some point. 

Not written with any sort of aim towards readability.
